# TOJam 2023: We lost count
The theme for this year's jam is *You must leave it behind*

## Our MVP
MVP:
- 3 characters we swap the leader for
- swapping leader affects group traits
- Size
- Speed
- Damage
- Goal is to reach end of level

Some areas of level, we hint at through the environment the ‘correct’ leader, so like an area that slows you down a lot so you need speed leader to get through, but in it damaging the enemy is hard so you need to swap in this swamp area to DPS down the enemy, then also swap to speed
- Size element, area is blocked
